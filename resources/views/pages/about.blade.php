        <h1>About us</h1>
        <h3>Our vision:</h3>
        <blockquote>A centre of excellence in science and technology enriched with GNH values.</blockquote>
        <p class="jumbotron" id="abt">
            The College of Science and Technology (CST) is the first institute in the country to offer 
            undergraduate degree programmes in engineering under the Royal University of Bhutan.  The college 
            aspires to be a centre of excellence in the field of science and technology enriched with GNH values 
            by offering quality programmes that are relevant to the need of the job market both within and outside 
            the country.<br><br>

            The College, which was originally called Royal Bhutan Poytechnic (RBP), was founded at Dewathang, 
            Samdrup Jongkhar in Southern Bhutan in 1972 under the vision of Late 3rd King Jigme Dorji Wangchuk. 
            Initially, the institute started offering diploma in civil and electrical engineering and later in 1988, 
            the diploma programme in mechanical engineering was also introduced.  It was relocated to the present 
            location, Rinchending in 2000 with the command of the Fourth Druk Gyalpo  with an up gradation into an
             engineering college from polytechnic. The institute was then named Royal Bhutan Institute of Technology
              and offered undergraduate degree programmes in Civil and Electrical.<br><br>
                
            With the establishment of the Royal University of Bhutan, the RBIT became a federated member of 
            the Royal University of Bhutan in June 2003. The number of students enrolled for the first time in 
            degree in Civil Engineering was 15 and in Electrical Engineering it was 10. Most of these students were
             diploma graduates from RBP. The first batch of 18  engineers graduated on 30th June 2005 and second 
             batch of 24 engineers graduated on 30th June 2006. With the shifting back of the Royal Bhutan Polytechnic 
             (now called Jigme Namgyel Polytechnic) back to Dewathang the diploma programmes got segregated from RBIT
              in 2006. The Institute has been renamed as the College of Science and Technology (CST).<br><br>
                
            College of Science and Technology(CST), is now responsible to oversee the tertiary education system in the 
            Kingdom of Bhutan in the field of science and technology. The College presently offers Bachelor degree 
            programmes in Civil Engineering and Architecture, Electrical Engineering, Electronics and 
            Communications Engineering and Information Technology. The curriculum got evolved to address the
             quality, internationalization and with the urgent need felt by the country. Besides the regular 
             programmes, the College, having been duly identified and recognized by the Royal Civil Service 
             Commission, conducts short-term trainings, workshops and courses for in-service civil servants, 
             particularly for technical professionals. Our campus offer high quality learning, teaching and research 
             spaces to better meet the needs of students, academics and researchers.
